# Julia EIT

Dear Visitor Over the next weeks I'm gonna build a Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) Library similar in spirit to [PyEIT](https://github.com/eitcom/pyEIT) or [EIDORS](https://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/).

I'm doing this because of there being several downsides with the existing libraries, like:
- lack of Integration with Machine Learning Frameworks
- Lack of Documentation
- Performance deficits
- Lack of integration with FEM frameworks

Please [contact me](mailto:dn.boigk@gmail.com) if you wish to participate.

This Library wil be build on Ferrite.jl, Enzyme.jl, Lux.jl and Reactant.jl. However lateron I will also consider integration with other Galerkin methods like based on spectral methods 

I'm actively looking for a students assistant job or a grant in order to build this library. This library is basically my masters thesis.
